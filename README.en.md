**BasicIconProvider** is a **minimal learning-oriented library** for retrieving  
**file and folder icons in WPF applications**.

It uses Windows `SHGetFileInfo` to provide a **simple, synchronous, low-feature implementation**,  
ideal for developers who want to learn how icon retrieval works in WPF.
